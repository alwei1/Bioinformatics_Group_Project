#This is a new layout of the work distribution for the Bioinformatics Project
#Ryan did all of the work with the NIH database in terms of identifying transcripts and retrieving homologous protein sequences
#Colin performed the sequence alignments and generated HMMs
#Colin and Ryan both attempted to write the code for the HMMsearch...Only Ryan's code worked... :(
#Alicia wrote all the code for generating the plot to display the data
#Alicia wrote the short answer
